          <h2>Josh's Side of the Story</h2>
          <p>
            Josh and Sujin met online while living in San Francisco. It all started with a “things I’m really good at” entry attached to Josh’s online profile. “I’m really good at building Ikea furniture.” Sujin found that pretty funny and decided to start the conversation between the two. After a week of talking they decided to meet up at Little Baobab in the Mission on a hot day. Big mistake since the place didn’t have air conditioning. Luckily both Josh and Sujin didn’t mind each other having a hard time keeping it cool on such a warm day. Dinner went so well, Josh asked Sujin out for dessert at a local ice cream shop. They enjoyed each others company so much they decided to keep hanging out and ended the night by grabbing a few drinks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just when it seemed like everything was history, Josh decided it was time to move to Chicago. This complicated the relationship quite a bit, but they both decided to try long distance dating and the two have been together ever since.
          </p>

          <h3>The Engagement</h3>
          <p>
            Josh and Sujin share the same passions and interest when it comes to food and farming. They went to the farmers market together and developed good relationships with the local farmers and merchants. It was November X 2014 when Josh decided he wanted to propose to Sujin on the way back home from the farmers market. When it was time to pop the big question, Josh took the ring out of his pocket and forgot how to speak when he saw Sujin tearing up. Instead of a well spoken proposal, Josh could only say “Will you marry me?” Sujin was tearing up so much she had trouble answering and the two were a mess made for each other.

          <h2>Sujin's Side of the Story</h2>
          <p>It all started with Sujin asking Josh, "Where were you when I was building my IKEA furniture?" After a few weeks of talking, Josh and Sujin decided to meet up. When they got to the restaurant, there wasn't any a/c...and of course the first thing Josh says to Sujin when they sit down is, "You sweat a lot." Cool Josh COOL. Some good food and lots of conversation later, they ended up at Mitchell's Ice Cream...and then an avocado ice cream scoop and some more conversation later, they ended up at a bar talking until the wee hours of the morning.</p>

          <p>Josh and Sujin loved spending time with each other and just talking. On their 4th or 5th...or 6th date, Josh had one too many gin and tonics and Sujin had to drive him home. On the way home, Josh proposed to Sujin while singing Beyonce's Single Ladies. Who knew that one drunken proposal story would end with them actually engaged?? (Years later of course).</p>

          <h3>The Engagement</h3>
          <p>
            On the way home from the farmer's market, Josh popped the question! He forgot all the words and Sujin wouldn't stop crying. It was a hot mess. Luckily, Josh and Sujin can laugh it off and still laugh about it to this day.
